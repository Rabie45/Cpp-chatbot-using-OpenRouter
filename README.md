# Cpp-chatbot-using-OpenRouter
A C++ chatbot application that leverages the OpenRouter API to provide AI-powered conversational capabilities. This project demonstrates how to integrate modern AI language models into a native C++ application.

## Key Features
  - OpenRouter API Integration: Connects to multiple AI models through OpenRouter's unified API
  - C++ Implementation: Built with modern C++ for performance and efficiency
  - Cross-platform: Designed to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
  - Command-line Interface: Simple text-based interface for chatting with the AI
  - Configuration Support: Easy setup for API keys and model preferences

## Technical Stack
  - C++11 or higher
  - libcurl for HTTP requests
  - JSON parsing library (e.g., nlohmann/json)
  - Platform-independent implementation

### Potential Use Cases
  - Educational tool for learning C++ and API integration
  - Foundation for more complex AI applications
  - Demonstration of conversational AI in native applications
